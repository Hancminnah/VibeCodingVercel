## Introduction

Building an app today is more like describing a recipe than writing computer code. Using Google AI Studio’s **Build** mode, you can "vibe code"—meaning you tell the AI what you want, and it handles the technical heavy lifting.

This guide will walk you through creating a simple app and putting it on the internet for free.

## Create Your App in Google AI Studio
Think of Google AI Studio as your personal workshop.

1.  **Open AI Studio in Safari (Google Chrome didn't work for Mac):** Go to [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com).
2.  **Enter "Build" Mode:** On the left panel, look for a tab labeled **Build**. This is specifically designed to create full web applications rather than just simple text responses.
3.  **Describe Your App:** In the prompt box, type what you want in plain English.
    * *Example:* "Build a simple app that lets users track their daily water intake with a nice blue progress bar and a button to add 8oz."
4.  **Refine the Design:** Once the preview appears on the right, you can click on parts of the app and say things like "Make the background dark mode" or "Add a reset button." The AI will update the code for you instantly.

## Save Your Work to GitHub
GitHub is like a "save game" slot for your app's code. It stores the files so other services (like Vercel) can find them.

1.  **Create a GitHub Account:** If you don't have one, sign up at [github.com](https://github.com).
2.  **Create a Temporary Repository:**
    * Click the **+** icon in the top right and select **New repository**.
    * Under `Repository Name *`, Name it something like `temp_repo`.
    * Under `Choose visibility *`, Set it to **Private** if you want to keep it to yourself for now.
    * Click **Create repository**.
3.  **Connect in AI Studio:** 
    * In the top right corner of AI Studio, click on an icon that says **Save to GitHub** button. 
    * You will be prompted to sign in to your github account
    * After signing in, you will need to install & authorize Google AI Studio to access your repository.
    * Under `Only select repositories`, choose the temporary repository you just created (e.g., `github_account_name/temp_repo`).
    * Click **Install & Authorize**
    * You will be asked to verify and confirm your access (i.e. through email, authenticator app etc.)
    * Your AI studio is now connected to Github
4.  **Create a Repository:**
    * You will be asked to create a new repository
    * Choose a repository name (e.g., `my-water-tracker`) and repository description (e.g., `a simple app to track water intake`).
    * Keep it **Private** if you want to keep the code to yourself for now.
    * Click **Create Git repo**. After that click **Stage and commit all changes**. AI Studio will now send all the files it wrote to your GitHub account automatically.

## Deploy to the Web with Vercel
Vercel takes your files from GitHub and turns them into a live website link you can share.

1.  **Sign up for Vercel:** Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up using your **GitHub account**.
2.  **Import Your Project:**
    * Install Vercel
    * Under `Only select repositories`, choose the repository you just created (e.g., `github_account_name/my-water-tracker`).
    * Click **Install** to install the github account
    * Click **Import** to import the repository
3.  **Deploy:** Click the **Deploy** button. You don't need to change any settings!
4.  **Wait for the Magic:** In about 30 seconds, Vercel will give you a URL (like `my-water-tracker.vercel.app`). Your app is now live!

> **Note on API Keys:** If your app uses the Gemini AI to "think," you may need to add your API Key in the Vercel **Environment Variables** settings so the app has "permission" to use Google's brain.
